To ignite a bomerMan.js

Install node.js latest version

Install node package called "prompt-sync" via terminal with cmt "npm i prompt-sync"

Prompt-sync used to get input from user in runtime

Note: we can't get a input from user while using node.js from any online compiler available so please you any IDE with installed node.js on your local machine

And run a program with cmt "node "your filepath""  for ex : node "C:/users/sgnat/bomerman.js"
